# Task 6: Subqueries and Nested Queries

## Project: `subqueries.sql`

### Objective
This task demonstrates the use of **subqueries** and **nested queries** in SQL using the `library_db` schema. It showcases the ability to retrieve and manipulate data with advanced query logic, including:

- Scalar subqueries
- Correlated subqueries
- Subqueries in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `FROM` clauses
- Use of `IN`, `EXISTS`, `NOT IN`, and aggregations

### Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench
- Sample database: `library_db`

---

### Database Schema Overview

The database consists of the following tables:

- `author`: Information about book authors
- `category`: Book categories
- `book`: Book metadata
- `book_author`: Many-to-many link between books and authors
- `member`: Library members
- `loan`: Book loan records

---

### Learning Outcome

By completing this task, the following concepts were applied and reinforced:

- Writing efficient subqueries
- Handling nested logic in SQL
- Applying aggregation with subqueries
- Filtering using correlated and scalar subqueries

---

### How to Use

1. Open `library_db` in your SQL environment.
2. Execute the schema and insert scripts (if not already done).
3. Run `subqueries.sql` to test and learn from each query.
4. Modify or expand the queries for deeper understanding.
